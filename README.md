PI PRESENTS  - Version 1.6.1 (GTK)
==================================

pipresents-gtk is a major rewrite to make it compatible with Raspberry Pi Model 5 and with the Wayland Desktop environment introduced in RPI OS Bookworm.

In addition other changes have been made to remove unsupported software. I have also tidied up some of the profile fields that have grown like topsy over the 10 years of Pi Presents development.
 . Tkinter and PIL replaced by GTK4
 . RPI.GPIO replaced by GPIOZero
 . Chrome web browser replaced by webkit browser engine
 . mplayer based audio player by MPV video player now plays audio

GTK runs on a RPi5 or RPi4 under Bookworm with the Wayland DE. It will also run under Bookworm with the X11 DE. For both DE's there are currently some limitations listed in a later section.

GTK will run on a RPi3 or earlier but only with the X11 desktop environment.

To use GPIO on a RPi model 5 the GPIOZero I/O plugin must be used. This plugin will work with any model of RPi

WHAT IS PI PRESENTS
===================

Pi Presents is a toolkit for producing interactive multimedia applications for museums, visitor centres, and more.

There are a number of Digital Signage solutions for the Raspberry Pi which are often browser based, limited to slideshows, non-interactive, and driven from a central server enabling the content to be modified frequently.

Pi Presents is different, it is stand alone, multi-media, highly interactive, diverse in its set of control paradigms â€“ slideshow, cursor controlled menu, radio button, and hyperlinked shows, and able to interface with users or machines over several types of interface. It is aimed primarly at curated applications in museums, science centres, and visitor centres.

Being so flexible Pi Presents needs to be configured for your application. This is achieved using a simple to use graphical editor and needs no Python programming. There are numerous tutorial examples and a comprehensive manual.

For a detailed list of applications and features see here:

Running an Example Profile
--------------------------
From a terminal window opened in the pipresents directory type:

         python pipresents.py -p pp_mediashow_1p6
 
to see a repeating multimedia show

Exit this with CTRL-BREAK or closing the window, then:

          python pipresents.py -p pp_mediashow_1p6 -f
 
to display full screen

Now read the manual to try other examples.


UPDATING PI PRESENTS FROM PI PRESENTS KMS, BEEP OR GAPLESS
===========================================================

Backup the directories /home/pi/pipresents and /home/pi/pp_home. You will need to copy some of the files to a new SD card.

Pi Presents GTK requires Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm so first install the operating system on a new SD card and then follow the instructions above for a new install of Pi Presents GTK.

pipresents/pp_config
---------------------
Do not copy across pp_audio.cfg, pp_display.cfg, or pp_editor.cfg

If you have modified it, make the edits to  pp_web.cfg. If you are using a username other than pi then edit the appropriate fields.

Copy any other files you have changed in pp_config,  pp_email.cfg, pp_oscmonitor.cfg, pp_oscremote.cfg


pp_io_config in /pipresents or in a profile 
------------------------------------------ 
If using a Pi5 you must replace gpio.cfg with a .cfg file based on /pipresents/pp_resources/pp_templates/gpiozero.cfg. The fields differ considerably and you will need edit the file. It is recommended you do this for earlier models of RPi as gpio.cfg is ?????

Minor changes have been made to keys.cfg and keys_plus.cfg but these are backwards compatible, if you have changed them copy them across and maybe edit them. Instructions in manual and pp_templates.

Copy any other files you have made or changed from old to new /pipresents/pp_io_config directory.

/pipresents/pp_io_plugins
--------------------------
Copy any files you have made or changed from old to new /pipresents/pp_io_plugins directory. If you have timers in you plugin you will need to edit the code to move from Tkinter to GTK4

pp_track_plugins /pipresents or in a profile 
---------------------------------------------
Copy any files you have made or changed from old to new /pipresents/pp_track_plugins directory. You will need to edit the code to move from Tkinter to GTK4



Updating Profiles for use in Pi Presents GTK
--------------------------------------------

Copy the pp_home directory from your backup to the home directory of your SD card.

When you open a profile using the editor it will be updated from KMS, Beep or Gapless versions. You can use the update>update all menu option of the editor to update all profiles in a single directory at once.

You will now need to make the following manual modifications:

      * Video tracks using omxplayer are now removed and will be deleted from the profile by the update. Any reference to them will be retained.  You will need to create new equivalent tracks using the MPV Video track.

      * VLC Video tracks using VLC Player are now removed and will be deleted from the profile by the update. Any reference to them will be retained.  You will need to create new equivalent tracks using the MPV Video/Audio track. 

      * Audio tracks using mplayer are now removed and will be deleted from the profile by the update. Any reference to them will be retained.  You will need to create new equivalent tracks using the MPV Video/Audio track. 

      * Web tracks that used the UZBL browser are now removed and will be deleted from the profile by the update. Any reference to them will be retained. You will need to create new equivalent tracks using the Chrome Web track.
	  
	 * Chrome Web tracks that used the chromium browser are now removed and will be deleted from the profile by the update. Any reference to them will be retained. You will need to create new equivalent tracks using the Chrome Web track.

    * For Audio tracks the Audio Player volume range is now 0>100 instead of -60>0
      
    * Videoplayout has changed yet again back to its original method. See manual and pp_videoplayout_1p6 example
      
To help with replacing the removed tracks there are two features:

      * In the Editor, profile>validate will display errors for any track references that are to the removed tracks. 
      
      * In the Editor, show>view backup will show the parameters for the show and of all tracks in the associated medialist. This allows identification of removed anonymous tracks. The backup was made when the profile issue was last updated.
      
      * The format of the backup parameters display allows cut and paste of field content, particulary multi-line fields. The data is taken from /pp_home/pp_profiles.bak and uses the internal names for the fields, these are close to the names displayed by the editor except 'controls' which sometimes is displayed as 'links'


CONFIGURATION /pp_config
pp_display.cfg, display position is not required and will be ignored.
pp_display.cfg, in develop window x,y is now not used but must be present.
